# CLAGE GmbH devices REST API

## Hardware

CLAGE GmbH devices that do support [WLAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN) do also provide a [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API, which is used by the [CLAGE Smart Control APP](#apps) too.
This API sometimes is called "Homeserver API" but you do not need a dedicated HSX hardware if your CLAGE device is supporting WLAN:

* [E-comfort instant water heater
**DSX Touch**](https://www.clage.com/en/products/e-comfort-instant-water-heaters/DSX-Touch) *continuous-flow water heater supporting REST API over WLAN*
* new announced [**ISX**](https://www.haustechnikdialog.de/News/27889/Neue-E-Durchlauferhitzer-auf-der-ISH-2023) *will provide REST API and [Modbus RTU](https://github.com/clage-gmbh/clage_modbus#clage-gmbh-modbus-api)*

## Documentation

Unfortunately, the documentation is currently only available as a **[PDF in German](doc/CLAGE_HomeServer_API_v1.3.4.pdf)**. We will change that.

As an english reference you can have a look at the [third party examples](#third-party) already implemented and [usage examples in the Wiki](../../wiki#usage)

## APPs

REST API was originally developed for the smartphone APP **CLAGE Smart Control**:

* [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.clage.smartcontrol)
* [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/clage-smart-control/id1212749880)

## Third Party

Due to the open documentation, the interface has already been integrated into various other systems.
